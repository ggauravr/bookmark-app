# Creating the project

```bash
npx sv create bookmark-app
```

This sets up the project with SvelteKit and Vite. 

# Setting up Tailwind

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Look for SETUP: to look for all the files that you need to get up and running with a project using Tailwind, Svelte and Vite.
